# When to choose Quix Brign Your Own Cloud Enterprise Edition?

Our cloud offering is a great way to work with the Quix Platform for most use cases. We think of Quix in the cloud as the perfect way to use the platform if you prefer and require the managed experience. 

BYOC goes one step further than cloud by offering all the powers of the Quix Platform, along with the ability to control and scale the underlying services, infrastructure to fit your needs. 

When hosting your own Quix platform, you are in full control of how all its parts operate. We provide safe and sane defaults, but it is ready to be configured to fit your exact use case.

    The process of creating Quix Platform deliverables continues to be ISO 27001 certified. What this means is that the containers and services inside them you receive are built to stringent security standards. You can expect them to follow best industry practices and safe defaults. Once you install them on your environment, they become part of your processes and fall under your data security policies.

Once you install them on your environment, they become part of your processes and fall under your data security policies and therefore may or may not be ISO (and ISO27001 specifically) compliant.

    Running your own infrastructure on your premises (or in a co-location) is often more cost-efficient than most cloud offerings. This is particularly true if you have specific hardware requirements that are not easily met in the cloud, such as GPUs, FPGAs, ultra-high-speed storage or networking. However, for most use cases, Quix Cloud provides the best managed experience we offer.

    You may choose to run Quix BYOC in your own cloud environment, consuming reservations or quotas established in prior agreements with cloud providers. This has the potential to lower your operational costs, while maintaining a cloud presence with Quix.
