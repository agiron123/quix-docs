# When to choose Quix Brign Your Own Cloud Enterprise Edition?

Our cloud offering is a great way to work with the Quix Platform for most use cases. Teams who do not have specific requirements regarding security or underlying infrastructure may choose to build on our cloud offering and scale it to meet their needs. BYOC goes one step further than cloud and offers you all the powers of the Quix Platform, along with the ability to control and scale the underlying services, infrastructure to fit your exact needs.

    The process of creating Quix Platform deliverables continues to be ISO 27001 certified. What this means is that the containers and services inside them you receive are built to stringent security standards. You can expect them to follow best industry practices and safe defaults. Once you install them on your environment, they become part of your processes and fall under your data security policies.

    Exclusively. Quix BYOC Enterprise Editions are self-contained. _Only_ you store your data.

    Running your own infrastructure on your own premises (or co-located) tends to be more cost efficient than most cloud offerings. This is especially true if you have hardware requirements not easily fulfilled in the cloud including GPUs, FPGAs, very high-speed storage or networking, CPU architectures other than AMD64 and so on. If you know exactly what you're running and why, cloud tends to fall to second choice when deciding where to host your application, and Quix.

    The same is true for cloud reservations. If you have an existing preservation or other agreement with a cloud provider, you may want to choose running Quix yourself on capacity you already own.
