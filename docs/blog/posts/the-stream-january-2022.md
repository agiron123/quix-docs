# The Stream — January 2022 edition

The January 2022 edition of The Stream: covering this month in stream processing on the internet.

What’s a data-driven company if it doesn’t take an opportunity to drive its
content with data? Instead of filling our January newsletter with things we
think you should know, we turned back the clock to 2021 and considered what
other people like you — data engineers, data scientists and developers — want
to know.

The data revealed our most popular [tutorials](/blog-category/tutorial),
[explainer](/blog-category/explainer) blog posts, research reports and how-to
guides. It told us that the data engineering community is ravenous to learn
how to streamline data. They’ve realized that dumping raw data into a
warehouse for cleanup and query later makes everyone’s jobs harder than they
need to be.

The problem is that it’s complicated. Until now, no one except an elite
handful of tech juggernauts had harnessed the power of stream processing
because it took a literal army of engineers to do it.

We think the future of data is stream processing for everyone. Soon, you’ll
see businesses of every size processing data in memory, on a message broker
like Kafka to extract its value before their data gets sunk into a lake or
buried under ever-increasing volumes of data in a warehouse.

Based on our reader data, you think so, too. Many of you searched us out for
our tutorials on doing [real-time stream processing with Kafka and
Python](/blog/kafka-python-example). Many also looked for our research and
[head-to-head comparison](/blog/performance-limitations-python-client-
libraries) on how well Python-based stream processing client libraries
perform.

So, without further ado, here’s our digest of the top tutorials, explainers
and research reports from 2021 that were most helpful to our users.

## Kafka + Python = %$#&?!

Python gets the most love from data scientists and other data-friendly
developers, but when it comes to Kafka, Python gets the cold shoulder. Here’s
how they work together.

## Why is streaming data so hard to handle?

And why aren’t these difficulties already solved? Our CTO explains in not-too-
technical terms why stream processing has been out of reach for most
organizations — until now.

## Which Python library is best for stream processing?

When you build a product, you do research — exhaustive competitive research.

## Everything you wanted to know about Kafka but were afraid to ask

Kafka isn’t just tricky technology — it’s tricky terminology. Dig into what
makes Kafka different, when you should (and shouldn’t) use it, and how it
works.
