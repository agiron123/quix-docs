# The Stream — June 2022 edition

The June 2022 edition of The Stream: covering this month in stream processing on the internet.

<!-- more -->

The potential of stream processing never ceases to amaze me.

We’ve already written about how stream processing enables extensive
[personalization of commercial products](/blog/stream-processing-use-case-
personalization) and lets [businesses get the most up-to-date information to
the people who need it most](/blog/empower-employees-real-time-data). In an
effort to [improve the lives of individuals and societies](/blog/big-data-for-
public-good), teams have employed stream processing to increase the
effectiveness of donations, help doctors deliver tailored healthcare, make
cities safer and match people to the resources they need. The Quix team has
even demonstrated that stream processing [makes machines more
human](/blog/history-streaming-real-time-data).

But that’s just the beginning. I’ve recently learned more about the
application of stream processing to time-series data in national security and
disaster prevention. Michael Debouver, a cloud architect at Airbus, [recently
explained](https://www.kafka-summit.org/sessions/kafka-in-space) how his team
built a streaming architecture that ingests, moves and makes sense of
satellite data during an environmental catastrophe. The system doesn’t even
involve the internet, and it doesn’t lag for even two seconds. That way
emergency services know how to direct people to safety and create accurate
rescue plans. Other researchers are discovering [connections between armed
conflicts and climate
change](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-30356-x#citeas) through
time-series data and machine learning. Who knows what’s coming next?

Empowering products and people to immediately respond to data can save lives.
I’m honored that Quix offers one piece of the puzzle to make that possible.

## Can time-series data help researchers understand the relationship between
armed conflicts and climate change? Yes.

Find out how by reading “Modelling armed conflict risk under climate change
with machine learning and time-series data.”

## Decodable Streaming with Eric Sammer

Decodable Founder [@esammer](https://twitter.com/esammer) recently sat down
with the [@software_daily](https://twitter.com/software_daily) podcast to talk
about stream processing and its role in modern data platforms.
