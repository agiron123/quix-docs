# The Stream â€” April 2022 edition

The April 2022 edition of The Stream: covering this month in stream processing on the internet.

## In-person events are back!

We hosted two events in Berlin with more than 20 CTOs and 60 members of the
data community in March. We learned about the business necessity of real-time
analytics, how companies provide superior customer experiences by using real-
time data, and how to build a Python service that tracks, transforms,
delivers, and predicts heart rate in real time.

Questions about the modern data stack and how to assemble IoT devices kept us
talking late into both nights. It was wonderful to have in-person
conversations and hear about what streaming data applications are in the
works.

Stream processing is new and complicated technology. Weâ€™re honored to support
a community of people trying to figure it out together. The more perspectives,
experiences, and insights about tools, architecture and science, we can get
into the conversation, the better.

Weâ€™ll continue our meetups in April and May so you can connect with members of
The Stream at events in London, Berlin, Munich, and Prague. And no need to
worry if youâ€™re not in any of those places â€” weâ€™re still meeting up online.
Join us weekly for open coding sessions (you can find information in the
[Slack community](https://quix.io/slack-invite)) and other digital events.

Visit the [community page](/community) to find other streaming enthusiasts,
events and content, and for all of the details on meetups and events.

## Find other streaming enthusiasts at the Kafka Summit

This yearâ€™s Kafka Summit, focusing on event streaming and microservices, is
April 25â€“26 in London. Weâ€™ll be there talking about the possibilities and
benefits of stream processing. Say hello at the Quix booth to learn where the
afterparty is happening. ðŸ˜‰

## What differentiates real-time digital twins? And why are they interesting
for streaming data?

Data scientists typically use digital twins to create virtual representations
of physical objects, but they can also track the dynamic state of IoT devices,
factory equipment and other devices that generate telemetry.
