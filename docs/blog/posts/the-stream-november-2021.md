Here’s Quix’s November newsletter, our monthly roundup of helpful tutorials,
inspiring use cases and product updates from the prior month. If you’d like to
subscribe, scroll to the bottom of this page and sign up.

Our team is shipping features fast and furiously (but, you know, we’re a happy
bunch — not furious), so watch our blog for some big product announcements
coming shortly. We’re here to make life a whole lot better for folks using
streaming data to build data-driven products and real-time analytics.

Got a project you’d like to use streaming data for but unsure where to start?
Now you can [book a chat](https://calendly.com/clara-quix/30min) with one of
our friendly experts to talk through your project goals and technical
challenges. We’re here to make sure you get your next project off to a great
start.

We’d also love to hear from you, our community, on how you’re using Quix —
whether for work or for a personal project. Come on over to
[Slack](http://quix.io/slack-invite) to chat with us. Until next month, happy
streaming!

## Use case: predicting fleet availability with real time data

See a real-world application of machine learning and live data to improve
urban mobility. Includes a tutorial with turn-by-turn directions to build your
own version.
