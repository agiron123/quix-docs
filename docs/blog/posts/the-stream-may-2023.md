## Bridging the gap between data scientists and engineers in machine learning
workflows

Moving code from prototype to production can be tricky—especially for data
scientists. There are many challenges in deploying code that needs to
calculate features for ML models in real-time. I look at potential solutions
to ease the friction.

We’ve featured many of Kai Waehner’s writings in this newsletter and it’s
great to see Kai dedicate his latest post to the Open Source library Quix
Streams ([Github](https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams)) and Python stream
processing. He demonstrates with context and examples why pure Python is an
excellent strategy for many ML use cases.
