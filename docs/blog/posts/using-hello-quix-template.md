# Get started in minutes with the Hello Quix template

Learn how to get started quickly with Hello Quix base template and use it as a foundation for your projects.

## What is the Hello Quix template?

The Hello Quix template is a simple three-step pipeline that you can use as a
basis for any project. It streams data from a small CSV to a Kafka topic. From
there, it’s consumed by a basic aggregation process which writes the output to
a second topic. Finally, the output is consumed by a basic logging service.

Here's a short video that introduces the template in a bit more detail:

### Why use the Hello Quix template?

Perhaps our other project templates don't quite fit your needs, and you need
to start from the basics. However, you might also find it a little cumbersome
to start with a completely empty pipeline. The Hello Quix template is a bare-
bones option that helps you skip the boring parts of building up a pipeline
while avoiding some of the clutter that might come with other more complex
project templates.

### Using the template

Here's a video guide that shows you what each component does and how to reuse
the project template (opens in YouTube):
