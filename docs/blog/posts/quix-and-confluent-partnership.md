# Accelerating AI-ready application development: Quix and Confluent partnership

Teams can now build AI applications on Confluent’s data in motion, with Quix, the AI-ready event streaming application framework.

## Introduction

Confluent will go down in history as _the_ company that set the world’s data
in motion. We have long admired this mission having experienced the power of
Apache Kafka at McLaren Racing where we used it to gain an advantage from
real-time data processing.

At McLaren we ingested streaming data into Kafka fairly quickly, but struggled
to roll out the technology across the business due to the [language
barriers](/blog/feature-engineering-language-problem) and [impedance
gaps](/blog/bridging-the-impedance-gap) inherent in modern, multi-disciplinary
technical organisations. Ultimately we spent three years building an internal
developer platform around Kafka, and still burned hundreds of hours supporting
developers across the team to build event streaming applications.

We founded Quix to solve these problems by building a tool that empowers AI
teams to develop real-time applications that run directly on Kafka without
complex infrastructure build-outs or high-touch support from platform teams.

Today, I’m delighted to announce the launch of a deep integration between Quix
and Confluent. Together with today’s announcement that Quix is a launch
partner in the Connect with Confluent programme, we fill a crucial gap in the
AI ecosystem and take a giant leap on our mission to empower developers to
unleash the full potential of real-time applications.

## Why Quix and Confluent are better together

Confluent is the de facto standard in streaming data. However, until now, one
critical capability has been missing from the ecosystem—the ability for teams
to rapidly develop AI applications directly on Kafka. This is where Quix steps
in, offering an event streaming application framework that empowers your teams
to unlock the full potential of real-time data.

## Conclusion

The partnership between Quix and Confluent represents a significant milestone
in the world of real-time applications. By combining the power of Confluent's
industry-leading Kafka platform with Quix's F1-derived event streaming
application framework, organisations can now build AI-ready applications
directly on data in motion in Confluent Cloud. Explore the [new use cases you
