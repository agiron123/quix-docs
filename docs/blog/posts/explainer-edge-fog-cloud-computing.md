# Edge, fog and cloud computing: Where you process data matters

Computing in the cloud, in the fog or at the farthest edge can make a significant difference in technical applications that are processing large volumes of data at high speeds

## Dig into an explainer on the differences between edge, fog and cloud

In 1996, a group of technology executives at Compaq Computer began using the
term “[cloud
computing](https://www.technologyreview.com/2011/10/31/257406/who-coined-
cloud-computing/).” They described a future in which services would move
offsite and files would be stored on the web, accessible from any internet
connection. Their vision proved to be true and the term cloud computing stuck.

Today most folks know what we mean by “in the cloud.” But newer terms, such as
fog computing, cloudlets and the edge, might have you wondering just where
that data is going. We’ve got you covered in this simple explainer.  

## What is edge computing?

> _“The terms cloud, fog and edge computing all refer to where the computing

To understand the extended cloud analogy, it helps to know that the terms
cloud, fog and edge computing all refer to where the computing process takes
place. When processing happens on or beyond the periphery of the cloud, we
start to talk about it as edge computing, with the farthest edge being the
closest in proximity to where the data is generated.

Edge computing can store, process, or send data from the edge to the cloud, so
nothing is lost. It simply reduces the time needed to turn that data into
action, making it useful in cases where low latency is critical or a back-and-
forth exchange with the cloud is unnecessary. Think of self-driving cars,
industrial IoT sensors, and even some of the apps on your wearable device.

Speed and efficiency gains make edge computing attractive for both consumer
and industrial markets. Usage forecasts predict that 37% of the global
infrastructure edge footprint will be for mobile and residential consumer use
cases, with the remaining 63% supporting markets such as healthcare,
manufacturing, energy, logistics, smart cities, retail and transportation,
according to Equinox’s [2021 State of the
Edge](https://www.equinix.com/resources/whitepapers/state-of-edge-

## What is fog computing?

As I explained earlier, cloud, fog and edge all refer to where the processing
takes place. Following that logic, fog computing takes place between the edge
and the cloud. It could arguably be described as near-edge computing. The
terminology is still evolving as the technology advances.

The differences between computing in the cloud, in the fog or at the farthest
edge might be hard for humans to detect, but they make a significant
difference in technical applications that are processing large volumes of data
at high speeds.  

## Understanding cloud, fog and edge terminology

The language around edge and fog computing is still evolving with a lot of
overlap between terms. This graphic helps break things down by showing which
common terms refer to.

**Near edge, far edge, outer edge:** These terms refer to proximity as
measured from the central data center out. So the near edge is close to the
cloud while the far or outer edge is on the periphery, close to the user
interface or data collection point.

**Client layer, user edge:** This is where events happen and data is collected
— a user interface, smartphone, IoT sensor, tech-enabled machinery, etc. It
includes devices and applications at the user’s location.

**Edge layer, service provider edge:** This is computing that happens on the
service provider’s network. It might be on the same premises as the user edge
and it can be used to manage data to and from the user edge. The service
provider or service edge is sometimes broken down further, based on the
proximity of the data center to the cloud, with the far edge being the closest
to the user edge.

**Internet or Network edge:** This is the boundary between a user interface or
data collection device and the network or internet.

**Cloudlets:** These are small-scale cloud data centers that operate on the
edge of the cloud. They provide low-latency computing to devices within close
geographical proximity.

**Client layer:** Device and applications that run on-site at a user’s
location.  

## Stream processing at the edge

While the location and underlying infrastructure might change based on where
the actual computing takes place, the types of processing taking place can be
the same as those happening in the cloud. In fact, some experts argue that the
edge is less about location and more about data processing capabilities.

“Edge Computing is definitely a thing, but the computing need not occur at the
edge. Instead what is needed is an ability to compute (anywhere) on streaming
data from large numbers of dynamically changing devices, in the edge
environment,” [writes Simon Crosby](https://www.infoq.com/articles/edge-
computing-streaming-data/), CTO of Swim.ai.

Stream processing transforms data into action as it is received. It cuts out
the traditional back-and-forth of batch processing for increased speed and
efficiency. This enables computing to happen outside the cloud and trigger
immediate action, such as detecting a fault on machinery and shutting it down
to prevent an accident, [alerting a doctor](/blog/big-data-for-public-good)
that a patient is at risk, or making sure that a mobile device is [using the
fastest network available in real time](/blog/network-connectivity-and-
resiliency).

Placing stream processing closer to the edge amplifies the speed and
efficiency gains. Up until recently, this [technology was prohibitively
hard](/blog/why-is-streaming-data-so-hard-to-handle) for most companies to
manage. But Quix is changing that for companies across industries.

of stream processing to teams of all sizes](/blog/release-pipeline-open-
