# The Stream — October 2021 edition

The October 2021 edition of The Stream: covering this month in stream processing on the internet.

You’re reading the first edition of Quix’s monthly newsletter, designed to
catch you up on our best content and product updates from the prior month. If
you’d like to subscribe, scroll to the bottom of this page and sign up. We’d
rather write software than emails, so we promise we’ll never spam you.

Our team has been hard at work through October, partnering with customers to
deliver some great new use cases. Watch our blog (or subscribe) as we share
more customer stories and in-depth tutorials.

Some of these seem impossible without a massive team of data and
infrastructure specialists. Before Quix, that was the challenge for many of
our customers. We break down the steps to show you how to deploy a machine
learning model to production in as little as 15 minutes. We share
architectural diagrams and how we run Quix on Quix to deliver a better pricing
model than subscriptions and contracts: usage-based billing.

We’d love to hear from you, our community, on how you’re using Quix — whether
for your day job or a passion project. Come on over to
[Slack](http://quix.io/slack-invite) to chat with us. And until next month,
happy streaming!

## Quix outperforms Spark and Flink in stream processing test

We compared client libraries — find out why Quix delivered 50x greater
performance than incumbents.

## Why is streaming data so hard to handle?

CTO Tomas breaks it down: stream processing is not for the faint of heart or
thin of wallet.

## Use case: Cybersecurity

How data stream processing, together with machine learning or AI, can be
applied to detect cyberthreats in real time.

  * [This a16z podcast](https://a16z.simplecast.com/episodes/data-alone-is-not-enough-the-evolution-of-data-architectures) includes a great takeaway from the CEO of Databricks [13:00]: “All the batch data out there is potential for streaming use cases. Stream processing systems have been too complicated to use, but under the hood, they take care of a lot of the data ops that people are doing manually today.” (Psst … that’s why Quix is here.)
