# 6. Conclusion

In this tutorial you have learned how to ingest data, using prebuilt code samples for real-time processing, how to view the data in different ways and how to query the data to enable model training. 

## Code Samples used

Here is a list of the open source Quix Code Samples used in this tutorial, with links to their code in GitHub:

* [New York Bikes](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/NY-Citibikes){target=_blank}
* [VisualCrossing Weather](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/sources/visualcrossing-weather){target=_blank}
* [New York Bikes - Prediction](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples/tree/main/python/transformations/NY-Bikes-Predictions){target=_blank}


## Next steps

Here are some suggested next steps to continue on your Quix learning journey:

* Try the [Telemetry data tutorial](../telemetry-data/telemetry-data.md).

* If you decide to build your own connectors and apps, you can contribute something to the Code Samples. Visit the [GitHub Code Samples repository](https://github.com/quixio/quix-samples){target=_blank}. Fork our Code Samples repo and submit your code, updates, and ideas.

What will you build? Let us know! We'â€™'d love to feature your project or use case in our [newsletter](https://www.quix.io/community/).
