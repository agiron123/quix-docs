# CitiBike data

Start by getting the real time bicycle data. Use our pre-built CitiBikes connector to get real time bicycle availability data (it doesn't require a sign up or any keys).

You won't need to write lots of code, you will use the Quix Code Samples to deploy a prebuilt service that streams data from the New York CitiBikes API:

1. Navigate to `Code Samples` using the left-hand menu and search for `New York` then select the `New York Bikes` tile.

2. Click `Setup and deploy`

	a. Leave the `Name` as it is.
	
	b. Ensure the `output` is set to `bikes-topic`.
	
3. Click `Deploy`

	The precompiled service will be deployed to your workspace and will begin running immediately.
