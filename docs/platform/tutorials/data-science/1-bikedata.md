# CitiBike data

Start by getting the real time bikes data. Use our pre-built CitiBikes connector to get real time bike availability data (it doesnâ€™t require a sign up or any keys).

Instead of writing a lot of code you will use the Code Samples to deploy a pre-built service that streams data from the New York CitiBikes api.

1. Navigate to `Code Samples` using the left hand menu and search for `New York` then select the `New York Bikes` tile.

2. Click `Setup and deploy`

	a. Leave the Name as it is.
	
	b. Ensure the `output` is set to `bikes-topic`.
	
3. Click `Deploy`

	The pre-compiled service will be deployed to your workspace and will begin running immediately.
