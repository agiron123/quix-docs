The Quix Portal includes Quix Samples, a collection of templates and sample projects that you can use to start working with the platform.

Quix allows explore the samples and save them as a new Project and immediately Run or Deploy them. If you donâ€™t have a Quix account yet, go [sign-up to Quix](https://portal.platform.quix.ai/self-sign-up?xlink=docs){target=_blank} and create one.
