# What is Quix?

Quix is a complete solution for building, deploying, and monitoring event streaming applications. 

!!! important

    For recent significant changes to Quix Platform, please see the [changes documentation](../platform/changes.md).

Streaming data applications, where you need to process time series or event data in order to make decisions in real time, is what Quix is designed for. 

With its roots in the demanding world of Formula 1 racing, where performance is paramount, Quix is built to deliver results. 

Such intelligent real-time decision making has many use cases, including examples such as increasing engagement with social media and digital content, monitoring vast arrays of sensors, fraud prevention, and of course Formula 1 race car telemetry systems.

Quix has excellent synergy with Machine Learning (ML) systems too. You can quickly deploy your ML model and monitor its performance in real time, modify the model, and redeploy it with a single click.

## Reducing complexity

Quix is also designed to remove as much complexity as possible from the process of creating, deploying, and monitoring your event streaming applications.

Quix leverages industry-standard technologies, such as Kafka to provide the core functionality for streaming data, Kubernetes for scaling your deployments, InfluxDB and MongoDB for data persistence, Git for revision control, and Python as the main language for programming your solutions.

The following sections take a look at the key components of creating your streaming data solutions:

* Connecting your data to Quix
* Developing your application
* Deploying (and scaling) pipelines
* Monitoring and managing your data

While this short introduction to Quix is intentionally brief, there are abundant links for more detailed information you can follow to increase your knowledge of Quix. Alternatively, simply drop into our [Community](https://forum.quix.io/){target=_blank} and ask any question you may have.

## The Quix Platform

The Quix Platform provides everything a developer needs to build industrial-strength event streaming applications. 

The components that make up the Quix Platform enable developers to:

* Use a full web-based IDE with version control and logging, to build, deploy, and monitor their event streaming applications. 
* Have abstracted access to underlying broker infrastructure, including fully-managed Kafka topics.
* Single-click deployment to the Quix serverless compute environment for hosting your web-based real-time streaming applications.
* Connect existing web applications and IoT clients.

In addition to providing a complete solution, Quix also enables you to leverage third-party providers if your use case requires it. For example, while Quix can host all your Git repositories, you can also configure your environments to use third-party providers for this purpose, such as GitHub, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps. 

Similarly, Quix provides Quix-hosted Kafka, but you can also use Confluent Cloud or self-hosted Kafka options.

## Quix architecture

This section describes the main technical components and architecture of Quix.

![Quix Technical Architecture](./images/quix-technical-architecture.png)

### Quix Portal

**Quix Portal** strives to present an intuitive software experience that facilitates DevOps/MLOps best practices for development teams. The goals of Quix Portal are to:

* Help a broad spectrum of developers access live data.
* Help developers create and manage complex infrastructure and write application code without support from expert engineering teams.
* Help to accelerate the development lifecycle by enabling developers to test and iterate code in an always-live environment.

To achieve these goals, Quix Portal includes the following features:

* **Online IDE**: Develop and run your streaming applications directly in the browser without setting up a local environment.

* **Code Samples**: Choose from the [prebuilt Code Samples](../platform/connectors/index.md) ready to run and deploy from the IDE.

* **One-click deployments**: Configure, deploy, and manage your streaming applications with a simple user interface.
 
* **Monitoring tools**: Monitor the status and data flow of your streaming applications in real time.

* **Broker management**: Create, delete, explore and configure your self-hosted message broker infrastructure from the Quix Portal.

* **Pipeline view**: Visualize your pipeline architecture with the information provided from the deployment variables. You can also monitor your pipeline in real time.

* **Data Explorer**: Explore live and historical data of your applications to test that your code is working as expected.

### Git integration

Quix has the ability to create projects where all code and configuration is contained in a Git repository. This Git repository can be hosted by Quix (using Gitea), or on any third-party Git provider, such as GitHub, or Bitbucket, where you can configure the Quix SSH public key provided to you for Git provider authentication. This helps integrate Quix with your existing workflows.

### Kafka integration

Quix requires Kafka to provide streaming infrastructure for your solutions.

When you create a new Quix environment, there are three hosting options:

1. Quix Broker - Quix hosts Kafka for you. This is the simplest option as Quix provides hosting and configuration.
2. Self-Hosted Kafka - This is where you already have existing Kafka infrastructure that you use, and you want to enable Quix to provide the event stream processing platform on top of it. You can configure Quix to work with your existing Kafka infrastructure using this option.
3. Confluent Cloud - if you use Confluent Cloud for your Kafka infrastructure, then you can configure Quix to connect to your existing Confluent Cloud account.

This enables you to select a Kafka hosting option according to requirements. For example, your production environment may be hosted on your own Kafka infrastructure, while your develop environment is hosted by Quix.

!!! tip

    To get your event streaming application to the testing stage as quickly as possible, the Quix-hosted Kafka option is recommended, as it requires zero configuration to get Kafka running. You can focus on your application code, without needing to do the up front work of creating a powerful scalable Kafka cluster, as that work has already been done for you by Quix.

### Docker integration

When you create an application from a template in Quix, a Dockerfile is provided for you in the `build` directory of the application. This uses a base image, and additions only need to be made in the case of special requirements, such as to include a library that is not part of the base image. The Dockerfile, combined with your code and configuration, is used to drive the Quix build service, which ensures the generated Docker image is registered with the Quix Docker registry. This image is then submitted to the Quix serverless engine, as part of the deployment process. All this is largely transparent to the developer - you simply click `Deploy` to build and deploy your application, and then monitor the deployment using the tools provided, such as the Data Explorer, logs, CPU monitor, and memory monitor.

### Infrastructure as code

When you develop your event streaming solution, you will build a pipeline of services that can be viewed in the Quix Portal. Each service in the pipeline is individually coded, using a standard component, a modified template, or even completely from scratch. Depending on the use case, pipelines can be quite complex, and in the past, this has made them time consuming to recreate. Now Quix supports infrastructure as code. Your entire pipeline can be defined by a single `quix.yaml` file, and this file can be used to completely and easily reconstruct a pipeline from its corresponding repository.

## Interfacing with Quix

There are [various ways](../platform/ingest-data.md) to connect your data to Quix. Quix provides a number of [connectors](../platform/connectors/index.md) that you can use with only some simple configuration. In addition, there are a range of [APIs](#apis), both REST and WebSockets that are available. There is also the [Quix Streams](#quix-streams) client library, that can be used to get data quickly and easily into Quix.

For a simple example of getting data from your laptop into Quix, see the [Quickstart](../platform/quickstart.md).

Quix provides numerous standard [connectors](../platform/connectors/index.md) for both source, and destination functions. In addition a number of transforms are also available. 

!!! tip

    To see available transforms, log into Quix. Open your project, and then an environment, and click on `Code Samples`. Then under `PIPELINE STAGE` select `Transformation`.

### APIs

Quix provides several APIs to help you work with streaming data. These include:

* [**Stream Writer API**](../apis/streaming-writer-api/index.md): enables you to send any data to a Kafka topic in Quix using HTTP. This API handles encryption, serialization, and conversion to the Quix Streams format, ensuring efficiency and performance of down-stream processing regardless of the data source.
* [**Stream Reader API**](../apis/streaming-reader-api/index.md): enables you to push live data from a Quix topic to your application, ensuring low latency by avoiding any disk operations.
* [**Query API**](../apis/query-api/index.md): enables you to query persisted data streams. This is provided primarily for testing purposes. 
* [**Portal API**](../apis/portal-api/index.md): enables you to automate Quix Portal tasks such as creating environments, topics, and deployments.

### Quix Streams

As you will notice as you explore the various open source code samples and connectors that come with Quix, Quix also provides a complete client library, [Quix Streams](../client-library-intro.md), to reduce development times, and provide advanced features such as automatic scaling through Streams.

Python is the dominant language for data science, data engineering, and machine learning, but it needs to be interfaced carefully with streaming technologies, such as [Kafka](../client-library/kafka.md), which are predominantly written in Java and Scala.

[Quix Streams](../client-library-intro.md) provides Python and C# developers with a client library that abstracts the complexities of building streaming applications.

For Python developers, Quix Streams can provide streaming data packaged in a data frame, so you can write data processing logic and connect it directly to the abstracted broker. Developers can read about the most important streaming concepts in the [Quix Streams introduction](../client-library-intro.md).

## Building with Quix

The basic flow that pipelines follow is ingestion, processing, and serving of data. These correlate to source, transform, and destination components within Quix.

These are described in more detail in the following sections.

### Pipelines

Event stream processing is implemented by building pipelines consisting of a series of applications deployed to Kafka and Kubernetes clusters. These processing pipelines are now described by a single YAML file, `quix.yaml`. With just this file, you can reconstruct any pipeline. 

Further, changes in this file in one environment can be merged into another environment, giving you the ability to test changes in one environment, before deploying into another, while the change history is retained in Git.

</div>

You can see that a typical pipeline is built from sources, transforms, and destinations.

You can see how to build a simple pipeline in the [Quix Tour](../platform/quixtour/overview.md). You can also [watch the video](https://www.loom.com/share/5b0a88d2185c4cfea8fd2917d3898964?sid=b58b2b0c-5814-494a-82ea-2a2ba4d4dac0).

### Multiple environments

In Quix you create a project to contain your event stream processing pipeline. A project corresponds to  a Git repository, either hosted by Quix, or alternatively using an external Git provider such as GitHub. Within a project you can create multiple environments, containing your event stream processing pipelines. Each environment is associated with a Git branch, so that you can embrace the full Git workflow, having for example, production, staging and development branches. You can also configure your preferred Kafka hosting option for the environment too, for example you can choose Quix-hosted Kafka, self-hosted Kafka, or Confluent Cloud.

Environments are a new feature of Quix, and you can read more about them in the [documentation](../platform/changes.md#environments).

### Monitoring and managing your data

Quix provides a suite of tools to enable you to monitor and manage your data. These include:

* Data Explorer - The Data Explorer enables you to view your data graphically in real time. Graph, table and messages views.
* Logs - Real-time logging information is displayed in a console tab. You also have the option of downloading your logs.
* CPU monitor - you can monitor the CPU utilization of your deployment in real time.
* Memory monitor - you can monitor the memory usage of the deployment in real time.

[See the Data Explorer in action](https://www.loom.com/share/0e3c24fb5f8c48038fe5cf02859b7ebc?sid=743fbdf7-fad5-4c26-831d-b6dad78b9b06).
