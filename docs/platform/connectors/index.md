# Connectors

Connectors are part of our open source repository of samples, examples and connectors.

Connectors specifically help our users connect with other vendors such as AWS and Kafka.

You can explorer the connector readme files here in Quix Docs, head over to the Quix Library repo in [GitHub](https://github.com/quixio/quix-library) or login to the platform and start using them.
