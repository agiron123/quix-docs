# Personal Access Token (PAT)

Personal Access Tokens, or PATs, are bearer tokens that can be used to authenticate the various Quix APIs, such as the Portal API, Streaming Reader API, and so on.

To obtain a PAT, log in to Quix, and click on your profile icon in the top right corner, then click `Personal Access Tokens`. You can then generate a PAT with a lifetime suitable for your use case.

Alternatively, log in to Quix, and click `Settings` in the main left-hand navigation. Then, for a specific environment, click `APIs and tokens`.

In the `APIs and tokens` dialog, you can click `Personal Access Tokens` to generate PATs, or a Streaming Token (SDK Token) for use with the Quix Streams client library.
