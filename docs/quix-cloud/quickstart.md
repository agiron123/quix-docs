# Quickstart - Deploy your local pipeline to Quix Cloud

Welcome to the Quickstart guide for deploying your local pipeline to Quix Cloud. 

In this tutorial, we'll walk you through the seamless process of transitioning your local pipeline to Quix Cloud unlocking the full potential of your data processing workflows.

With Quix Cloud, you can focus on developing and refining your pipeline without worrying about infrastructure management. Whether you're a small team or a large enterprise, Quix Cloud provides the flexibility and scalability you need to accelerate your pipeline development and deployment processes.

If you're new to Quix Cloud or need a refresher on its features, [learn more here](../quix-cloud/why-quix-cloud.md).

## Prerequisites

!!! warning "Important"

    Before proceeding, ensure you've completed the [Quix CLI Quickstart](../cli/cli-quickstart.md).

## Step 1: Sign up to Quix Cloud

It's free to [sign up to Quix Cloud](https://portal.platform.quix.io/self-sign-up){target=_blank}.

After signing up using the method of your choice, you'll be taken to the `Welcome to Quix` dialog, where you can create a new project, as shown in the next step.

## Step 2: Create your first project

You're now ready to create your first project. 

1. Click `Authorise` to connect your Github account to Quix.
2. Select the account that you used during the [Quix CLI Quickstart](../cli/cli-quickstart.md) to install the QuixIntegration application.
3. Select which repositories you wish to authorise access to (select at least the one containing the Quix pipeline code)
4. Click `Install & Authorize`.
5. Select the Git repository used during the [Quix CLI Quickstart](../cli/cli-quickstart.md) from the list provided.
6. Click `Create project`.

## Step 3: Create an environment of your project

1. Now, create an environment where the pipeline will be deployed. Enter "PRODUCTION" as the environment name.
2. Make sure the `main` branch is selected.
3. Click `Continue`.
4. Select the Quix managed broker.
5. Click `Create environment`. After the environment is fully created you are taken to your pipeline view.

## Step 4: Synchronize your Quix environment 

To synchronize your pipeline view with your Git repository, click the `Sync environment` button, which is located in the center of your pipeline view.

You'll be shown the `Sync to this commit` dialog. View the changes that are to be made and then click `Sync to this commit`.

In the pipeline view you can see your pipeline running:

![CLI Pipeline running](../images/cli/pipeline-quix-cloud.png)

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! Your pipeline is now deployed and running in the cloud! ðŸŽ‰

## Step 5: View a deployment running in Quix Cloud

In your pipeline view, click on the `event-detection-transformation` service panel.

You'll now see how much additional observability Quix Cloud gives you:

![Quix Cloud service details](../images/cli/event-detection-transform-quix-cloud.png)

Here you can explore the complete information of the service, including CPU amd memory utilization, topics being used, live data, logging, and much more. 

## Step 6: Explore the `Messages` tab

You can even explore individual Kafka messages being published to topics.

Click the `Messages` tab. This service has two topics associated with it, the input and output topics. Let's view the messages on the output topic.

In the `TOPIC` drop down, select the output topic `hard-braking`.

Click on a message to see its details:

![Message details](../images/cli/message-details.png)

You can see the JSON for the message.

You also have access to powerful tools, such as the `OFFSET` drop down, where you can select to view historical messages for example. If you view historical messages, and want to go back to seeing messages in real time, simply select `Live messages` from the drop down.

Feel free to explore further.

## Step 7: Continue development on the command line

You can now continue development on the command line. You can make changes to your pipeline locally, and test by running in Docker as you saw previously. When you are ready to deploy your changes to the Quix Cloud, you can simply run the following command:

```
quix local pipeline update
```

This updates your local `quix.yaml` file.

Then, to push your changes to your Git repository, and synchronize those changes with Quix Cloud, use:

```
quix local pipeline sync
```

You will see the following error:

```
You're not connected to Quix Cloud
```

To solve this, log into Quix Cloud using:

```
quix login
```

A `Device Confirmation` dialog is displayed in your web browser. Click `Confirm` to log in:

![Device Confirmation](../images/cli/device-confirmation.png)

Now check your status with `quix status`:

```
âœ“ Logged in
  User:                 somebody+testing@quix.io (Test User)
  Organization:         tony cli (tonycli)
  Current context:      default (https://portal-api.platform.quix.io)
  Default environment:  ! Not set
  Local Broker:         ! Not set
  Local Broker enabled? âœ— No
  Git Root:             /Users/tbedford/new-cli/cli-pipeline
âœ“ VS Code installed
! PyCharm not installed
âœ“ Docker installed
âœ“ Git installed
```

Check that you are shown as logged into Quix Cloud.

!!! tip

    If you delay in clicking `Confirm` in the `Device Confirmation` dialog, you might need to log in again, as the code may have timed out.

Now, run `quix local pipeline sync` again and you'll see something similar to the following:

```
Sending all changes to git ...
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

nothing to commit, working tree clean

! No changes were pushed
! Detected only one environment, selecting it automatically ...
âœ“ Project: CLI Pipeline
âœ“ Environment: CLI Pipeline - PRODUCTION
âœ“ Sync completed
```

You're changes are now synchronized from your Git repo to Quix Cloud. 

Now check your context by typing `quix context list` and you'll see something similar to the following:

```
   Name    â”‚ Portal Url                          â”‚   Default environment            â”‚   Local Broker  
â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”¼â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ 
 â†’ default â”‚ https://portal-api.platform.quix.io â”‚ âœ“ tonycli-clipipeline-production â”‚                 
```

You can see the correct environment has been selected for you.

## Next step
